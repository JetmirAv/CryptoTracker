- CryptoTracker is an application that lists all current crypto currencies, where you can select the cryptocurrency that you want and it opens a view where you can 
write the number in the text field and it converts it directly into dollars.

### Implementation

-The application has more than one view, we have enabled the transition from one view to another when we click on the list items, 
 we have a detail view where we can see the value in dollars, we have also used costum table row, in case you press any letter white writting the number in the textfield
 to convert it into dollars an alert box appears that tells us that the letters should not be used, with network call we get the list with cryptocurrencies, 
 we get the list for coinapi which is open source api then we save them in the internal database.
